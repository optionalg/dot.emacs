This configuration requires Emacs 24.x and el-get. To get el-get, you
can either use `apt-get install el-get` or follow the instructions
here: https://github.com/dimitri/el-get

All my symbol names are prefixed with `vbe/`. Here is a list of
important functions you may want to look at:

 - `vbe/require` (to load files in `~/.emacs.d`)
 - `vbe/add-package` (to add a package and execute something when loaded)

Feel free to explore what is done. Using the configuration as is may
not be a good idea, but all those files are licensed under ISC
